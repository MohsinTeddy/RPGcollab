Plot:
The Stone of Harmony was created to bring the Kingdom of Name to Great Power
The King routed this power to 5 major tribes within the kingdom but one tribe refused this power as to not have anyone abuse such power
Villan destroyed Stone of Harmony into 5 pieces and claims its power as his own.
He hides these shards in various Dungeons which will be conquered by the Hero.
When completing a Dungeon, the Hero collects one of the shards.
Each shard contributes to the villan's power and the Hero can decide:
1. Destroy the shard and weaken the villan while removing the chance the kingdom being restored
2. Keep the shards and have to fight a stronger villan, but also allowing for the kingodm to return glory
